## Recommended Betting Sites
- **[Pinnacle]**: Pinnacle is a bookie which offers Asian odds. One of the biggest advatgaes is that you will also not have any problems with limitations. We would definitely highly recommend this bookie. Please note that you have to be 18+ and that Pinnacle is not available in every country (e.g. Germany). Therefore, please check if you are eligible for registration before creating a new account.
- **[Fanobet]**: We also highly recommend to use this site for this service since they offer markets that very often no other site offers (e.g. CSGO: Team X < 12,5 points). You can deposit either with BTC or with real money. (PS: This is a reflink where you get 1% cashback)
- **[Nitrogen Sports]**: You can use this site if you are not eligible to bet on Pinnacle or Bet365. You can use BTC for depositing. Most of the time you will find the same bets as on Pinnacle. (PS: This is a reflink which helps us to gain some profit)
- **[Bet365]**: Bet365 is a European bookie with real money. You have to go through KYC identification, so don’t create an account if you are not eligible to do so. If you have a big bank and you win a lot, you will most likely get limited. Therefore, this bookie is definitely not recommended if you are high rolling.

We recommend to use Fanobet + Pinnacle / Nitrogen Sports / Bet365 for the best possible experience. If you cannot use one of the recommended bookies you will most likely not be able to place some bets, but you should still be able to gain profit.

## Interpreting the predictions

You can find all the predictions in the prediction channel on our Discord Server. Additionally, we will add the bets in a spreadsheet. This helps you to keep track of all bets. First of all, we can distinguish between two different kind of bets: single bets and multi bets/parlays.

- Single bets are the simplest form of betting. You predict an outcome, specify the desired stake and place the bet. If your prediction proves correct, you win the bet. The winnings are calculated by multiplying the odds by the stake, e.g. if you place a stake of EUR 5.0 at odds of 1.50, your possible winnings would be EUR 7.50.
- If you place bets on two or more results (e.g. on two different CSGO games) on the same betslip, they are automatically displayed as a multi (parlay) bet. In this case all picks are combined. All your selected picks must be correct to win a multi bet. The total odds are calculated by multiplying the odds of all the individual picks, e.g. if you place a stake of EUR 5.0 at odds 1.50, 2.00 and 1.80, your possible winnings would be EUR 27.00 because 1.50 x 2.00 x 1.80 x EUR 5.0 equals EUR 27.00. 

You will always find the odds at which we placed a bet in the prediction. Please place a bet only if you get similar odds (+-10% range) to make sure you are also placing a good- (value bet) and not a bad bet.  
Additionally, you will find the % of our bank we placed on the bet. Please note that this is just a suggestion. If you don’t feel comfortable with the amount we place, feel free to change it to your needs. However that we can't guarantee that you still make profit with your own bet sizing. If you aren't experienced in it, please stick to our suggestions.
We highly recommend everyone to create and use his own spreadsheet where you can track your own bets. Since your bank and bet sizing may vary and you will most likely skip or miss some bets, don’t just use our spreadsheet. Please note that a spreadsheet gives you a good overview of every bet you made and also helps our support team to assist you if you have any problems.
